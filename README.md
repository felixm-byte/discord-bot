# discord-bot
This is a discord bot that makes web searches. Replace the Google programmable search url and discord key space with your own values, and the bot will be able to join the server and perform web searches for you. It has multiple links - I'd recommend you use the first one for particularly relevant sites you want prioritised, use the second one for less relevant sites and use the third one for searching the wider web. This means that your users will get a super-relevant response if possible, but at worst will still get a response.
